- Hello I'm Edward a Computer Science student living in Georgia.
- I'm currently familiar with Python and Java. I'm working on getting better at C, C++ and C#. Interested in learning and working in the JUCE framework to develop VSTs to be used in music production. 
- In school I am currently learning about data structures and C. Outside of school I'm learning more about C# through Unity and C++ through Unreal Engine.
  Hoping to learn more about web development in the future.
- Willing to collaborate on anything just hoping to get some experience working with others!
